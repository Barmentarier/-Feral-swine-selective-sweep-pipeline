# -Feral-swine-selective-sweep-pipeline
A pipeline to perform analyses provided in Barmentlo 2023

The pipeline generates population structure measurements, while also generating markers and regions under selection. The pipeline is written for wildliife purposes and used on 60k SNP data. Note that especially the sweep analysis might not be appropriate with a different number of snps. Please assess the flowchart "Flowchart_selective_sweep" for the order of the scripts. The code was used to generate the results from doi:

Please note that I did not include all scripts used as many scripts were used on multiple populations. Additionally, there were quite a few script used to clean the data. I refer the reader to the publication to fully recreate this study.

Populations/clusters used:
- GRSM
- k16: Western Heritage (this is a genetic cluster)
- k17: European wild    (this is a genetic cluster)
- k15: Asian            (this is a genetic cluster)
- NC: North Carolina
- SC: South Carolina
- TN: Tennessee
- WV: West Virginia
